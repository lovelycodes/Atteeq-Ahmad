    <!-- What I did before Codeworks-->
    <p> I done lot of odd jobs before coming to CodeWorks. I started working with my Dad back really early days of my
        Childhood.
        I worked with my Dad's shop for several years, than found job at shop, which worked as several things together,
        Like
        ceiling, curtains, blinds and carpet fitting. After that I moved to Thailand, lived there for about 3 years.
        Also done several odd jobs there, like server and restaurant
        daily duties, also done some construction things with some other contractor.
        After that I moved to States and being doing several jobs here too. Started working at grocery store as a baker
        and bakery manager assistant.
        Also done interpreting and server while other jobs going on. Finished somewhat college after moving to States.
        I been driving semi truck from last couple years, and quite it last december. As I had quality background with
        IT and computer
        decided to come back what I love and enjoy doing.
